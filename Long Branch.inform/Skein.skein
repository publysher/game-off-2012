In 1878, the American Frontier is still very much alive. Especially so in the new settlement called Dodge Town. As the endpoint of the Great Western Cattle Trail, it is nicknamed the Queen of the Cow Cities. Founded only six years ago, Dodge Town is growing rapidly and known as a true frontier settlement.

You are Glen &quot;The Gentleman&quot; Fletcher, outlaw by name, gentleman by nature.  Only two days ago you robbed a bank in Abilene and decided to lay low for a while in this interesting town. You have arrived safely, but you have one pressing need: you are very hungry and need some food as soon as possible.

Travelers on the road have suggested dinner in the Long Branch Saloon. 

 
Dinner at the Long Branch Saloon
An adventure on the American Frontier by Publysher
Release 1 / Serial number 121110 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Long Branch Saloon
The saloon is dominated by a long bar to the right. Behind the bar, a few pictures try to liven up the place, accompanied by the obligatory pair of bull&apos;s horns.

At the back of the saloon a few rickety chairs and tables have been haphazardly put down. Here too, a half-hearted attempt to liven up the place has been made by adding a few pictures. Below the pictures you can see today&apos;s menu. 

You can see a barman here.

You can review your surroundings at any time by typing LOOK. Try it -- type LOOK now. (Or, if you don&apos;t need instructions, you can turn the tutorial off by typing TUTORIAL MODE OFF.)

Now, it turns out that you&apos;re holding something. To find out what, try typing INVENTORY.

You approach the barman: &quot;Good afternoon&quot;.

&quot;A good afternoon to you as well, sir. How may I help you? &quot;

&quot;I&apos;d like some food,&quot; you say.  

&quot;But of course,&quot; the barman replies, &quot;such a desire is not unheard of. But could you be so kind as to first make a choice from our menu?&quot;

And that covers most of what you need to know! There are lots of other verbs you can type as you go along, but you&apos;ll likely be able to guess them from context. Don&apos;t be afraid to experiment with new actions.

To stop the game, type QUIT; to save your current position, type SAVE. RESTORE allows you to bring back a game you have previously saved, and RESTART starts the game over again at the beginning.

You&apos;re on your own now.
